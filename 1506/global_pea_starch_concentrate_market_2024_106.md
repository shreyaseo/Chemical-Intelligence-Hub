<h1>Global Pea Starch Concentrate Market Research Report 2024(Status and Outlook)</h1><p>The global <strong>pea starch concentrate market</strong> is projected to grow from <strong>USD 1.2 billion in 2024 to USD 1.9 billion by 2030</strong>, expanding at a steady <strong>CAGR of 6.8% during 2024â2030</strong>, according to the latest industry analysis. This growth trajectory reflects rising demand for plant-based ingredients across food, pharmaceutical, and industrial applications.</p><p>Pea starchâa polysaccharide extracted from yellow peasâhas gained prominence as a sustainable alternative to conventional starches due to its <strong>non-GMO status, gluten-free properties, and lower environmental footprint</strong>. The ingredient's <strong>exceptional gelling, thickening and binding capabilities</strong> make it particularly valuable in <strong>clean-label food formulations, pharmaceutical capsules, and biodegradable packaging</strong> solutions.</p><p><strong>1. Plant-Based Food Revolution:</strong><br>
The explosive growth of plant-based dietsâprojected to capture <strong>15% of global protein market share by 2030</strong>âhas accelerated pea starch adoption. Food manufacturers are reformulating products with pea starch to meet demand for <strong>allergen-free, non-GMO ingredients</strong>, with pea starch appearing in <strong>28% of new clean-label product launches</strong> in 2023.</p><div><b>Download FREE Sample of this Report @

Pea starch's superior compressibility and disintegration properties have made it a preferred excipient, with the pharmaceutical sector accounting for <strong>22% of total demand</strong>. The market is further boosted by <strong>6.2% annual growth in hard capsule production</strong>, where pea starch increasingly replaces gelatin for vegetarian formulations.</p><p><strong>3. Sustainability Imperative:</strong><br>
With pea crops requiring <strong>70% less water than corn</strong>âthe primary source of conventional starchâenvironmental considerations are reshaping procurement strategies. Major brands now attribute <strong>12-15% price premiums</strong> to sustainable sourcing credentials involving pea-based ingredients.</p><p>The industry faces several hurdles that could temper growth:</p><p><strong>Processing Limitations:</strong> Current extraction technologies recover only <strong>55-60% of available starch</strong> from peas, creating yield gaps that keep production costs <strong>18-22% higher</strong> than corn or potato starch alternatives.</p><p><strong>Supply Chain Fragmentation:</strong> Unlike established starch crops with concentrated production, pea cultivation remains geographically dispersed, causing <strong>regional price variations up to 35%</strong> and complicating logistics.</p><p><strong>Functional Property Gaps:</strong> While excellent for gelling, pea starch exhibits <strong>lower freeze-thaw stability</strong> than modified corn starches, limiting adoption in frozen food applications without costly additives.</p><p><strong>1. Next-Gen Extraction Technologies:</strong><br>
Innovations in <strong>enzyme-assisted wet milling and membrane filtration</strong> are pushing starch recovery rates above 75% while reducing water usage by 40%. These advancements are critical for improving margins and environmental profiles.</p><p><strong>2. Circular Economy Applications:</strong><br>
The <strong>USD 8.3 billion biodegradable packaging sector</strong> presents untapped potential, with pea starch-based films demonstrating <strong>comparable barrier properties to PET</strong> in controlled humidity conditions.</p><p><strong>3. Sports Nutrition Expansion:</strong><br>
As the <strong>USD 47 billion sports nutrition industry</strong> shifts toward plant-based formulations, pea starch's slow carbohydrate release profile is gaining attentionâclinical studies show <strong>23% longer energy release</strong> compared to maltodextrin in endurance applications.</p><p><strong>Vertical Integration:</strong> Leading players are securing pea supplies through farm contracts while investing in proprietary processing technologies to control quality and costs.</p><p><strong>Precision Fermentation:</strong> Startups are combining pea starch with fermented proteins to create novel functional ingredients for meat analoguesâa segment growing at <strong>14% CAGR</strong>.</p><p><strong>Regional Taste Adaptation:</strong> In Asia, manufacturers are modifying pea starch's flavor profile to minimize legume notes disliked in traditional rice-based products.</p><p>The market features a mix of global agribusinesses and specialized players, with <strong>Roquette, Ingredion and Cosucra</strong> leading through technological partnerships with food majors. Emerging regional producers like <strong>Shuangta Food</strong> and <strong>Yantai Oriental Protein Tech</strong> are gaining share through cost-competitive offerings tailored to local markets.</p><p><strong>By Grade:</strong></p><p><strong>By Application:</strong></p><p>This press release summarizes findings from the comprehensive research report <em>Global Pea Starch Concentrate Market Research Report 2024(Status and Outlook)</em>, providing detailed analysis of market size, segmentation, competitive dynamics, technological developments, and strategic recommendations.</p><div><b>Download FREE Sample of this Report @
