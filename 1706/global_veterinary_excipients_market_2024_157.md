<h1>Global Veterinary Excipients Market Research Report 2024(Status and Outlook)</h1><p>The global <strong>veterinary excipients market</strong> is projected to witness substantial growth from <strong>2024 through 2030</strong>, driven by increasing demand for companion animal medications and innovations in veterinary pharmaceutical formulations. As the animal healthcare sector expands globally, excipients play an increasingly critical role in drug delivery systems, stability enhancement, and bioavailability improvement.</p><p><strong>1. Rising Companion Animal Population and Healthcare Expenditure:</strong><br>
With <strong>68% of U.S. households</strong> owning pets and veterinary care expenditure growing at <strong>6.2% annually</strong>, the demand for specialized veterinary medications has surged. Excipients facilitate the development of palatable, stable formulations crucial for pet medications - especially important when considering that <strong>38% of pet owners</strong> report challenges administering medication to their animals.</p><p><strong>2. Technological Advancements in Drug Delivery:</strong><br>
Innovative excipient technologies now enable extended-release formulations, taste-masking, and improved solubility for poorly-water soluble active ingredients. Modified-release excipients alone accounted for <strong>28% of veterinary drug development projects</strong> in 2023, reflecting the industry's focus on compliance and efficacy enhancement.</p><div><b>Download FREE Sample of this Report @
