<h1>Global Ceramic Grade Sodium Carboxymethyl Cellulose (CMC) Market Research Report 2024(Status and Outlook)</h1><p>The global <strong>ceramic grade sodium carboxymethyl cellulose (CMC) market</strong> is expected to grow from <strong>USD 286 million in 2024 to USD 412 million by 2030</strong>, expanding at a <strong>CAGR of 6.3%</strong> during the forecast period, according to new market analysis. This steady growth reflects rising demand from advanced ceramics applications in electronics, medical devices, and industrial components where CMC serves as a crucial binder and rheology modifier.</p><p><strong>1. Electronics Industry Expansion:</strong><br>
With the global electronics ceramics market projected to reach <strong>USD 16.2 billion by 2027</strong>, ceramic grade CMC is seeing increased adoption in multilayer ceramic capacitors (MLCCs) and semiconductor packaging. The material's ability to provide uniform viscosity and controlled drying properties makes it indispensable for thin-layer ceramic formulations.</p><p><strong>2. Medical Ceramics Boom:</strong><br>
The medical ceramics segment, growing at <strong>7.1% annually</strong>, extensively uses CMC in dental prosthetics and orthopedic implants. Its non-toxic nature and precise binding characteristics enable manufacturers to meet stringent ISO 13485 quality standards while improving production efficiency by <strong>15-20%</strong>.</p><div><b>Download FREE Sample of this Report @
