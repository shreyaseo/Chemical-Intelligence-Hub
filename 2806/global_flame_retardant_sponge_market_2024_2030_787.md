<h1>Global Flame Retardant Sponge Market Research Report 2024-2030(Status and Outlook)</h1><p><strong>The global flame retardant sponge market is projected to grow from USD 1.12 billion in 2024 to USD 1.98 billion by 2030</strong>, registering a steady <strong>CAGR of 5.8% during the forecast period</strong>, according to industry analysts. This growth trajectory reflects increasing regulatory pressures for fire safety across multiple industries, coupled with rising demand for lightweight, high-performance materials in aerospace, automotive, and industrial applications.</p><p>Flame retardant spongesâspecialized polyurethane or silicone-based materialsâhave become critical components in safety-critical applications due to their unique combination of fire resistance, thermal insulation, and cushioning properties. These materials are increasingly specified in environments where fire safety compliance is non-negotiable, from aircraft interiors to electric vehicle battery compartments.</p><p><strong>1. Stringent Fire Safety Regulations:</strong><br>
Global tightening of fire codes, particularly in construction and transportation sectors, has created mandatory demand. The aerospace industry now requires flame retardant materials that meet <strong>FAR 25.853 and EASA CS-25 standards</strong>, while building codes in Europe and North America mandate materials that achieve <strong>Class B or higher fire ratings</strong>.</p><div><b>Download FREE Sample of this Report @
