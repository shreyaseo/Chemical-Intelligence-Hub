<h1>Global Denitration Market Research Report 2024(Status and Outlook)</h1><p><strong>The global denitration market is poised for significant growth between 2024 and 2030</strong>, driven by escalating environmental regulations and increasing demand for clean air technologies. According to industry analysts, this sector is responding to the urgent need to reduce nitrogen oxide (NOx) emissions from industrial processes, particularly in power generation and chemical manufacturing.</p><p><strong>1. Stringent Environmental Regulations:</strong><br>
Governments worldwide are implementing stricter emissions standards, forcing industries to adopt denitration technologies. The <strong>European Union's Industrial Emissions Directive</strong> and <strong>U.S. Clean Air Act Amendments</strong> have been particularly influential, creating a 35% increase in demand for selective catalytic reduction (SCR) systems since 2021.</p><p><strong>2. Rising Coal-Fired Power Plant Upgrades:</strong><br>
Despite the global shift toward renewable energy, coal remains a significant power source in developing economies. Many plants now require retrofitting with denitration systems to meet new emission standards, creating a <strong>$2.8 billion retrofit market opportunity</strong> through 2027.</p><div><b>Download FREE Sample of this Report @
