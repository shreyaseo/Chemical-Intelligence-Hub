Dermatological Applications:</strong><br>
Research into sandalwood's <strong>Î±-santalol compound</strong> shows promising results in treating psoriasis and eczema, with clinical trials demonstrating <strong>39% greater symptom relief</strong> versus standard treatments.

Green biotechnology firms are scaling production to address supply issues while meeting EU Organic certification standards.</p><p><strong>3. Asian Market Expansion:</strong><br>
China's traditional medicine revival is driving <strong>14% annual growth</strong> in therapeutic sandalwood applications, particularly in Guangdong and Zhejiang provinces. Local players are pioneering <strong>water-soluble sandalwood extracts</strong> for nutraceutical beverages targeting urban wellness consumers.</p><p><strong>Precision Authentication:</strong><br>
    Advanced <strong>GC-MS and isotope testing</strong> are becoming industry standards to verify purity, with leading brands investing in blockchain traceability systems that track oil from plantation to product.</p><p><strong>Conservation Partnerships:</strong><br>
    Major cosmetic brands are funding <strong>sandalwood reforestation initiatives</strong> in Karnataka and Tamil Nadu, creating vertically integrated supply chains that ensure both sustainability and quality control.</p><p><strong>Micro-Dosed Formulations:</strong><br>
