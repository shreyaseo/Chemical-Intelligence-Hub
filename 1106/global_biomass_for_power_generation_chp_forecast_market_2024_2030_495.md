<h1>Biomass for Power Generation and CHP Market, Global Outlook and Forecast 2024-2030</h1><p>The global <strong>biomass for power generation and CHP market</strong> is poised for substantial growth, projected to expand from <strong>$12.8 billion in 2024 to $25.3 billion by 2030</strong>, registering a steady <strong>CAGR of 6.2%</strong> during the forecast period. This robust trajectory reflects intensifying global commitments to renewable energy and the growing recognition of biomass as a critical transitional fuel in the decarbonization of power infrastructure.</p><p>Biomass solutionsâincluding solid biofuels, biogas, and municipal wasteâare gaining prominence for their ability to deliver <strong>baseload renewable power while utilizing existing fossil fuel infrastructure</strong>. When deployed in combined heat and power (CHP) configurations, these systems achieve <strong>80-90% total efficiency</strong>, outperforming conventional power plants by significant margins.</p><p><strong>1. Policy Support and Carbon Neutrality Commitments:</strong><br>
With over <strong>130 countries</strong> now committed to net-zero targets, biomass plays a pivotal role in national decarbonization strategies. The EU's RED III Directive mandates <strong>42.5% renewable energy in heating/cooling by 2030</strong>, driving substantial investments in biomass CHP plants across member states. Meanwhile, the U.S. Inflation Reduction Act provides production tax credits of <strong>$30/MWh for qualified biomass facilities</strong>.</p><div><b>Download FREE Sample of this Report @

The Russia-Ukraine conflict has accelerated Europe's shift toward domestic biomass resources, with wood pellet imports from Russia plunging <strong>92% in 2023</strong>. This geopolitical realignment has spurred <strong>$4.7 billion in new plant investments</strong> across Scandinavia and Central Europe, designed to utilize local forestry residues and agricultural byproducts.</p><p><strong>3. Technology Convergence:</strong><br>
Advanced gasification systems now achieve <strong>45% electrical efficiency</strong>âa 60% improvement over traditional combustion plants. When combined with carbon capture (BECCS), these solutions deliver <strong>negative emissions</strong>, positioning biomass as a key player in hard-to-abate industrial sectors.</p><p>Despite strong fundamentals, the industry faces complex challenges:</p><p><strong>Feedstock Volatility:</strong> Rising competition for sustainable biomass has caused wood pellet prices to fluctuate between <strong>$220-$320/ton</strong> in key markets, impacting project economics. Some regions report <strong>40% cost increases</strong> for certified feedstock since 2021.</p><p><strong>Regulatory Complexity:</strong> Evolving sustainability criteria require operators to implement comprehensive certification systems, adding <strong>12-18 months</strong> to project timelines. The UK's strengthened biomass criteria now mandate <strong>full supply chain due diligence</strong> down to forestry operations.</p><p><strong>Infrastructure Limitations:</strong> Many developing regions lack established collection systems for agricultural residues, resulting in <strong>30-50% utilization rates</strong> for available biomass resources. This fragmentation increases transportation costs and complicates supply security.</p><p><strong>1. Industrial Decarbonization:</strong><br>
The hard-to-abate industrial sector presents a <strong>$18 billion opportunity</strong> for biomass CHP, particularly in pulp/paper, food processing, and chemical industries. Sweden's HÃ¶rneborgs Verkstad recently demonstrated <strong>94% fossil fuel displacement</strong> using locally sourced forest residues.</p><p><strong>2. Hybrid Energy Parks:</strong><br>
Co-locating biomass plants with wind/solar farms creates resilient renewable hubs. Germany's BioSolar Park Hassfurt combines <strong>10MW biomass with 1.4MW solar</strong>, achieving <strong>98% capacity factors</strong> while providing grid stability services.</p><p><strong>3. Advanced Feedstock Solutions:</strong><br>
Novel energy crops like miscanthus and short-rotation coppice can increase yields by <strong>3-5x compared to traditional sources</strong>. The EU's GRACE project has mapped <strong>18 million hectares</strong> of marginal land suitable for such dedicated biomass cultivation.</p><p><strong>Torrefaction Advancements:</strong><br>
	Densified torrefied pellets now offer <strong>25% higher energy density</strong> than conventional wood pellets, dramatically reducing transportation costs. Major producers like Zilkha Biomass Energy are scaling this technology for international markets.</p><p><strong>Digital Supply Chains:</strong><br>
	Blockchain-enabled tracking systems like those deployed by Estonia's Graanul Invest provide <strong>real-time sustainability verification</strong> from forest to plant, addressing critical compliance requirements.</p><p><strong>Small-Scale Modularization:</strong><br>
	Containerized biomass systems (plug-and-play solutions that reduce installation timelines by 70%.</p><p>The market features a mix of <strong>energy majors, specialized biomass firms, and utility providers</strong>:</p><p>European utilities like <strong>RWE and Vattenfall</strong> continue to dominate large-scale deployments, leveraging existing district heating infrastructure.</p><p>North American players such as <strong>Drax Group and Enviva</strong> lead in pellet production, supplying over <strong>6 million tons annually</strong> to overseas markets.</p><p>Asian manufacturers including <strong>Sumitomo Heavy Industries</strong> are pioneering high-efficiency gasification systems tailored for rice husk and palm waste.</p><p><strong>By Technology:</strong></p><p><strong>By Feedstock:</strong></p><p><strong>By Application:</strong></p><p><strong>By Scale:</strong></p><p><strong>Europe:</strong> The mature yet innovation-driven leader, accounting for <strong>48% of global capacity</strong>, with stringent sustainability standards shaping technology development.</p><p><strong>North America:</strong> Strong pellet export focus paired with growing domestic CHP adoption, particularly in U.S. manufacturing corridors.</p><p><strong>Asia-Pacific:</strong> The fastest-growing region, with China and India investing heavily in agricultural residue systems to address both energy needs and rural waste challenges.</p><p><strong>Latin America:</strong> Emerging opportunities in sugarcane bagasse systems, with Brazil leveraging its <strong>300 million ton/year</strong> biomass potential.</p><p>This press release is based on the comprehensive market study <em>Biomass for Power Generation and CHP Market: Global Outlook and Forecast 2024-2030.</em> The analysis delivers actionable insights across technology, feedstock, application, and regional segments, providing stakeholders with strategic market intelligence for informed decision-making.</p><div><b>Download FREE Sample of this Report @
