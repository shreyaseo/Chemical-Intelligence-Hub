<h1>Sericin Market - Global Outlook and Forecast 2025-2032</h1><p>The global <strong>sericin market</strong> is projected to grow from <strong>USD 325.7 million in 2024 to USD 572.9 million by 2032</strong>, expanding at a <strong>CAGR of 7.3% during 2025-2032</strong>, according to new market analysis. This growth trajectory reflects surging demand for bio-based ingredients across cosmetics, pharmaceuticals, and medical textiles, particularly in Asia-Pacific where silk production remains concentrated.</p><p>Sericin, a natural glycoprotein constituting 20-30% of raw silk's composition, has emerged as a multifunctional biomaterial. Its <strong>moisture retention, antioxidant, and UV protection properties</strong> make it particularly valuable in premium skincare formulations, while its <strong>biocompatibility and wound-healing characteristics</strong> are driving adoption in advanced medical applications.</p><p><strong>1. Clean Beauty Revolution and Natural Cosmetics Boom:</strong><br>
With natural cosmetics representing <strong>32% of global skincare launches</strong>, sericin's plant-derived origin and bioactive properties position it as an attractive alternative to synthetic ingredients. Recent studies show sericin enhances skin hydration by <strong>40% compared to conventional moisturizers</strong>, making it particularly valuable in anti-aging formulations.</p><div><b>Download FREE Sample of this Report @
