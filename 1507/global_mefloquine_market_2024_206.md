<h1>Global Mefloquine Market Research Report 2024(Status and Outlook)</h1><p><strong>The global mefloquine market</strong> is projected to expand from <strong>USD 105.6 million in 2024 to USD 152.3 million by 2030</strong>, growing at a <strong>CAGR of 6.1%</strong> during the forecast period. This antimalarial drug continues to demonstrate clinical relevance despite increasing competition from alternative therapies, particularly in high-risk tropical regions and among military and traveler populations requiring malaria prophylaxis.</p><p><strong>1. Persistent Malaria Burden in Endemic Regions:</strong><br>
Despite progress in malaria control, the disease causes <strong>247 million cases annually</strong> across 85 countries, with Africa bearing 95% of cases. Mefloquine remains a WHO-recommended prophylactic option, especially for chloroquine-resistant Plasmodium falciparum strains prevalent in Southeast Asia and Sub-Saharan Africa.</p><p><strong>2. Military and Travel Medicine Demand:</strong><br>
The U.S. Department of Defense maintains strategic stockpiles of mefloquine, with <strong>35% of deployed personnel</strong> in malaria-endemic zones receiving prophylaxis. Meanwhile, the rebounding global travel industry - projected to reach <strong>1.8 billion international arrivals by 2030</strong> - sustains demand among non-immune travelers.</p><div><b>Download FREE Sample of this Report @
