<h1>Global Dual-curing Adhesives Market Research Report 2024(Status and Outlook)</h1><p>The global <strong>dual-curing adhesives market</strong> is projected to experience significant growth between 2024-2030, fueled by increasing demand from electronics and automotive sectors. While traditional curing methods still dominate, the unique advantages of dual-cure systems â combining UV/light curing with secondary moisture or thermal curing mechanisms â are driving adoption in applications requiring complete curing in shadowed areas.</p><p><strong>1. Electronics Miniaturization Boom:</strong><br>
As electronic devices shrink in size but grow in complexity, manufacturers increasingly adopt dual-cure adhesives for their ability to bond delicate components without thermal stress. The global microelectronics adhesives market, where dual-cure systems play an expanding role, is expected to grow at <strong>8.2% CAGR</strong> through 2030.</p><p><strong>2. Automotive Lightweighting Initiatives:</strong><br>
Automakers seeking to reduce vehicle weight while maintaining structural integrity are turning to advanced adhesive solutions. Dual-cure systems enable bonding of mixed materials â from carbon fiber composites to advanced polymers â with <strong>30-45% faster processing times</strong> versus traditional methods.</p><div><b>Download FREE Sample of this Report @
