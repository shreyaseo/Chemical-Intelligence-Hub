<h1>Moisture-proof Plasterboard Market, Global Outlook and Forecast 2024-2030</h1><p><strong>The global moisture-proof plasterboard market is projected to grow from USD 5.2 billion in 2024 to USD 7.8 billion by 2030</strong>, expanding at a steady <strong>CAGR of 6.9% during the forecast period</strong>, according to a detailed industry analysis. This growth trajectory reflects increasing demand for <strong>water-resistant construction materials</strong> across residential and commercial projects worldwide.</p><p>Moisture-proof plasterboard â a specialized drywall variant incorporating hydrophobic additives â has become essential for modern construction, particularly in <strong>high-humidity environments and wet-area applications</strong>. These advanced boards prevent moisture absorption, resist mold growth, and maintain structural integrity in challenging conditions.</p><p><strong>1. Rising Construction Activity in High-Humidity Regions:<br></strong>
Global urbanization and infrastructure development, especially in tropical climates, are driving demand for moisture-resistant building materials. <strong>Over 38% of new construction projects in Asia-Pacific</strong> now specify moisture-proof plasterboard as standard in bathrooms, kitchens, and basements.</p><div><b>Download FREE Sample of this Report @

New regulations mandating mold-resistant materials in residential construction are reshaping project specifications. The <strong>2024 IECC updates</strong> now require moisture-proof boards in all wet-area applications, while European EN standards have tightened permissible moisture absorption rates by <strong>15-20%</strong> compared to 2020 benchmarks.</p><p><strong>3. Growth in Renovation and Remodeling:<br></strong>
Homeowners are increasingly opting for moisture-proof solutions during renovations, with <strong>68% of bathroom remodels</strong> in North America now using specialized plasterboard. The aging housing stock in developed markets is creating sustained demand for moisture-resistant upgrades.</p><p>While the outlook remains positive, several factors could moderate growth:</p><p><strong>Raw Material Price Volatility:<br></strong>
Gypsum and silica prices have fluctuated by <strong>12-18% annually</strong>, putting pressure on manufacturers' margins. This volatility stems from supply chain disruptions and fluctuating energy costs for production.</p><p><strong>Installation Skill Gaps:<br></strong>
Proper handling of moisture-proof boards requires specialized techniques that <strong>42% of contractors</strong> in emerging markets lack, according to recent trade surveys. Misapplication can negate the product's performance benefits.</p><p><strong>Alternative Material Competition:<br></strong>
Emerging fiber-reinforced polymer panels currently threaten to capture <strong>7-9%</strong> of the moisture-resistant segment, especially in commercial applications demanding extreme durability.</p><p><strong>1. Smart Building Integration:<br></strong>
Next-generation moisture-proof boards with embedded sensors can monitor humidity levels in real-time, creating opportunities in <strong>premium smart home and healthcare facility markets</strong>. These advanced products currently command a <strong>25-30% price premium</strong> over conventional options.</p><p><strong>2. Sustainable Formulations:<br></strong>
Manufacturers are developing eco-friendly variants using recycled gypsum and bio-based hydrophobic additives. These green products now account for <strong>18% of new product launches</strong> and align with tightening sustainability regulations in Europe and North America.</p><p><strong>3. Growing DIY Market:<br></strong>
Consumer-friendly moisture-proof board systems designed for homeowner installation are gaining traction, with major retailers reporting <strong>40% year-over-year growth</strong> in this segment.</p><p><strong>Product Performance Enhancements:<br></strong>
Leading manufacturers are introducing boards with <strong>integrated vapor barriers</strong> and antimicrobial treatments, reducing installation steps while improving performance.</p><p><strong>Regional Product Adaptation:<br></strong>
Companies are tailoring formulations to local climate conditionsâdeveloping <strong>high-temperature resistant versions</strong> for Middle Eastern markets and <strong>cold-climate optimized boards</strong> for Scandinavian regions.</p><p><strong>Digital Supply Chain Transformation:<br></strong>
Major producers are implementing blockchain-based material tracking from quarry to jobsite, with <strong>35% of the industry</strong> expected to adopt such systems by 2026 to verify product authenticity and performance claims.</p><p>The market features a mix of global construction material giants and regional specialists:</p><p><strong>British Gypsum</strong> leads in European technological innovation with its Moisture Panel line</p><p><strong>USG Sheetrock Brand</strong> dominates North American distribution channels</p><p><strong>Knauf</strong> excels in cost-efficient production for emerging markets</p><p><strong>Siniat</strong> (Etex Group) specializes in high-performance commercial solutions</p><p>The competitive environment is intensifying as mid-sized players like <strong>Galloway Group and Jayswal</strong> gain market share through localized production and customized solutions.</p><p><strong>By Product Type:</strong></p><p><strong>By Application:</strong></p><p><strong>By Installation Area:</strong></p><p><strong>Asia-Pacific:</strong> The largest and fastest-growing market, driven by China's construction boom and Southeast Asia's tropical climate needs</p><p><strong>North America:</strong> Mature but stable market with strong renovation demand and stringent building codes</p><p><strong>Europe:</strong> Focused on sustainability and product innovation, with Germany and the UK leading adoption</p><p><strong>Middle East &amp; Africa:</strong> Emerging opportunities in luxury real estate and hospitality sectors</p><p><strong>Latin America:</strong> Growing middle-class housing projects creating new demand</p><p>This press release summarizes findings from the comprehensive report <em>Global Moisture-proof Plasterboard Market Outlook and Forecast 2024-2030</em>.
